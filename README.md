# SegmentationforAutonomousVehicles

The mission of this project is to create some image segmentation models on the Cityscapes dataset and  deploy one of the model as Flask.

* How to create the test--train-validation datasets
* Exploratory Data Analysis with the datasets.
* Use a Xception model & UNET model built from scratch for segmentation.
* Use three pretrained Models Vgg-Unet, Unet-mini, Mobilenet and compare their performance.
* Treat the Mobilenet segnet model under augmentation.
* Deploy the Mobilenet model as Flask.
